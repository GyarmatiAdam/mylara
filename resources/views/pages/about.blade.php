                                        <p>No, it is not like James Bond, because I am not a secret agent. 
                                                I do not even kill people. The only business I have with this theme, 
                                                is that I really like Bond movies!</p>
                                        <p>Actually, I like all kinds of movies; just as sport in general, 
                                                friends but the most I love is my Wife and my Family.</p>
                                        <p>In the winter of 2018 I decided to start a new 
                                                career – following the example of my friend – in web-development. 
                                                And now, couple of months and courses later here I am, writing my 
                                                own website’s ‘About me’ page. Hopefully, I will become a useful 
                                                member of an amazing developer team. Actually, it is not a hope: 
                                                only a matter of time and hard work.</p>
                                        <p>At the beginning, coding just seemed an interesting thing but as 
                                                I have immersed myself in this topic, it became love. Love, 
                                                which I wake up and go to sleep with. It amases me, what CSS is capable of 
                                                ; what Javascript can do with a simple HTML file; how PHP cooperates with an 
                                                SQL database. And the funny thing is, that I still haven’t seen much of it. 
                                                Let’s do it then!</p>
